    <h1>The Perfect Gift (A Christmas Short Story)</h1>
    <img id="one" src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/29852719/pexels-photo-29852719/free-photo-of-festive-night-street-in-cuenca-ecuador.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=2">
    <p class="story">Lila had searched everywhere for the perfect Christmas gift for her boyfriend, Jake. Nothing felt right. Then, as she wandered through an antique shop, she found it—a small, snow globe with a quaint little village inside. The tag read: "Make a wish."

        “This is it,” she thought, buying it immediately. <br/> <br/>
        
        On Christmas Eve, she handed the gift to Jake. “Shake it and make a wish,” she said playfully.<br/> <br/>
        
        Jake chuckled and gave it a good shake. Snow swirled inside, and the tiny village lit up. “I wish for the best Christmas ever,” he said.<br/> <br/>

        But as the snow settled, a strange thing happened. Lila and Jake weren’t in her living room anymore. They were standing inside the snow globe.<br/> <br/>
        
        “What just happened?!” Jake exclaimed, staring at the giant glass dome around them.<br/> <br/>
        
        The cozy village inside was real—charming cottages, snow-covered streets, and a glowing Christmas tree in the square. It was perfect.<br/> <br/>
        
        At first, they panicked, running in circles, shouting for help. But soon, the villagers came out, welcoming them warmly, offering hot cocoa, cookies, and even a carriage ride through the sparkling snow.<br/> <br/>
        
        “This place is... amazing,” Jake admitted, holding Lila’s hand as they marveled at the twinkling lights.<br/> <br/>

        “But we can’t stay here forever,” Lila said, gazing at the glass sky above them.<br/> <br/>
        
        As if in answer, a note fluttered down from nowhere. It read: "To leave, simply wish for home."<br/> <br/>
        
        Jake looked at Lila. “What do you think? One more sleigh ride before we go?”<br/> <br/>
        
        She smiled. “Definitely.”<br/> <br/>
        
        After the ride, they stood by the glowing tree. Together, they shook the snow globe and said, “We wish to go home.”<br/> <br/>
        
        In a flash, they were back in her living room, the snow globe sitting quietly on the coffee table.<br/> <br/>
        
        “Best Christmas ever?” Lila asked, grinning.<br/> <br/>
        
        Jake laughed, pulling her into a hug. “Without a doubt.”<br/> <br/>
        
        The snow globe sparkled on the table, the tiny village inside glowing softly, waiting for its next visitors.<br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>
